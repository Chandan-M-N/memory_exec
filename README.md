# memory_exec

Clone the repo:
```shell
  git clone https://github.com/Chandan-M-N/memory_exec.git
```

Change the directory to downloaded directory.
```shell
  cd memory_exec
```

Run the memory.py file to decrypt the files and run it in memory.
```shell
  python memory.py
```

1. fn1.py, fn2.py and main.py are files which I used to test.
2. I encrypted the files fn1.py, fn2.py and main.py
3. The encrypted files are saved in the disk.
4. Running memory.py will decrypt the files, load it into memory without saving it in disk and executing the main.py in memory.
